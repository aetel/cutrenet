This is a simple Python CRUD application to manage AETEL members.

# STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

## Use:
Launch setup.py, if a database exists it will use that, if not it will create one.
When database is fresh it creates a user admin@example.com/admin.
Then launch the main python script.
Go to /register to register a new member.

## To-Do:
* ~~Use actual passwords~~ Now it uses hashed passwords with bcrypt
